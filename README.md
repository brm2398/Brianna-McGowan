BRGM website using open source framework and design

Code to move is my mantra that articulates the importance of coding to build, inspire, learn, and have fun. From data science and engineering to creative movement, codetomove is a spectrum of my interests and talents that make up who I am.

I code to move women and people of color into tech, and change the face of the industry. We challenge the bias in our data and demand integrity. Humans donâ€™t need big data, big data needs humanity. 

Delicious Democracy is gathering every second Tuesday of the month in 2020 to experiment and lay a framework to build EQUITISM. Delicious Democracy is DC's Creative Advocacy Lab building a cultural and political community nourished by face-to-face creative experimentation.

EQUITISM:
An economic and political system grounded in community ownership, systemic balance, and infinite play. Equity means having a seat at the table and a stake in governance, accountability, and collective prosperity. 

Equitism Manifesto: https://codetomove.com/manifesto.html
Equitism is an economic and political system grounded in community ownership, balancing systemic tensions, infinite play, and intersecting worlds.
