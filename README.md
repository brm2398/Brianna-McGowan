BRGM website using open source framework and design

Code to move is my mantra that articualates the importance of coding to build, inspire, learn, and have fun. From data science and engineering to creative movement, codetomove is a spectrum of my interests and talents that make up who I am.

I code to move women and people of color into tech, and change the face of the industry. We challenge the bias in our data and demand integrity. Humans donâ€™t need big data, big data needs humanity.
